## Overview

Fund 3 is dedicated to supporting projects in launching on the Internet Computer's Service Nervous System (SNS). The SNS is a fundamental component of the ICP ecosystem, enabling the creation, deployment, and management of canisters (smart contracts).

Fund 3 aims to facilitate the successful launch of innovative projects on the SNS, providing the necessary resources, guidance, and support to ensure a smooth and impactful deployment. By actively contributing to the growth of the SNS ecosystem, Fund 3 aims to enhance the overall functionality and adoption of the Internet Computer Protocol.

## Exits
The ICVC Dao treasury will receive tokens from projects supported by the SNS Fund. With the tokens, the Dao will be able to exit investments by pre-determining a spread limit price for token sale. These exit limits will be triggered via smart contract plugins into third party DEXs. They will also be subject to adjustements over time, via SNS votes.
